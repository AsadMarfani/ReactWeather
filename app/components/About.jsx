				<li>
					<a href = "http://openweathermap.org/">Open Weather Map</a> - Called the API from this website to fetch current Weather.
				</li>

				<li>
					<a href = "https://github.com/AsadMarfani/ReactWeather.git">GitHub Repo</a> - All the source code related to this app can find it here.
				</li>
